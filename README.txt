This projects goal is to replicate the findings of the 2023 paper:
L. Zhu et al., "Stress Detection Through Wrist-Based Electrodermal Activity Monitoring and Machine Learning," 
in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, vol. 27, no. 5, pp. 2155-2165, May 2023

Currently following functionalities are implemented:
-segmentation of the signal
-Component Separation
-Feature Extraction
-Database (not fully supported)
-CSV export of data

Planned functionalities:
-Data splitting
-Classification using machine learning techniques
-Accuracy review

Optional functionalities:
-Comparison Neurokit vs cvxEDA component separation
-low pass filter vs no filter comparison
-more datasets
-multimodal approach( EEG, PPA,...)
